## 4 Target Segments — Pain Points & Value Props

### 1. Interior Companies
**Pain points:**
- Managing 5-10+ concurrent show flat/site projects across cities
- Tracking hundreds of material types (fabrics, tiles, fixtures, paint, hardware, furniture, glass, wood)
- Coordinating multiple trades simultaneously (carpenters, painters, electricians, plumbers, glass workers, fabricators)
- Tight deadlines tied to developer launch dates
- Client (developer) expects professional progress updates
- Material theft/wastage on unmonitored sites
- Subcontractor billing disputes (retentions, deductions, measurement disagreements)

**What to highlight (in this order):**
- Task & Planning — multi-layered project plans with timelines/dependencies, break show flats into tasks & sub-tasks, assign to teams, track across all sites from one dashboard
- Material & inventory tracking across all sites — what's ordered, delivered, used, pending
- Design management — keep drawings organized, coordinate with site teams, track approvals
- Subcontractor work orders & RA billing with retentions
- Budget vs actuals per project — know margins in real-time

**Recommended plan:** Business+ (has BOQ, Design Management, Budget Control, Purchase Orders)

## Email Structure (Follow This Format)

```
Subject: [Specific to their business — mention their type of work or a pain point]

Hi [First Name],

[1-2 sentences: Who you are + why you're reaching out. Reference their specific business type.]

[1 paragraph: What Onsite does — tailor to their segment. Mention specific modules that solve THEIR problems. Use concrete examples.]

[1 paragraph: Social proof or scale — 2,000+ companies, 50,000+ projects, the 4-7% cost savings stat if relevant. Or mention similar companies in their segment already using it.]

[1 paragraph: Specific value for THEIR business — pick 3-4 bullet points from the segment pain points above. Make them feel like you understand their daily challenges.]

[CTA: Ask for demo. Keep it simple — "Would you be open to a 15-20 min demo?" or "Let us know a good time to connect."]

Best,
Dhruv

```

### Subject Line Rules
- Keep under 60 characters
- Reference their business type or a specific pain point
- No clickbait, no ALL CAPS
- Examples:
  - "Managing interior projects across multiple sites?"
  - "Project coordination for [Company Name]"
  - "Simplifying material tracking for interior firms"
  - "A better way to manage your construction sites"

### Tone Rules
- Professional but human — like a knowledgeable colleague suggesting something useful
- NO flattery ("impressive portfolio", "amazing work")
- NO overselling ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "transform your business")
- DO show you understand their industry ("interior firms typically juggle 8-10 trades per project")
- DO mention specific Onsite features by name (not generic "we help with project management")
- DO include a concrete number or stat (2,000+ companies, 4-7% savings, 50,000+ projects)
- Dhruv is messaging, Sumit (founder) is on CC — this shows seriousness without being heavy

### Length
- 150-250 words body (not counting signature)
- 3-4 paragraphs max
- Enough substance to show value, short enough to actually get read

## Onboarding & Support Talking Points (If They Ask)

- Structured 3-step onboarding: Company Setup → Office Team → Site Team

## Self-Update Rule

After every outreach email Dhruv approves or gives feedback on:
1. Note what worked / what Dhruv changed
2. Update this skill with the learning
3. Future emails should incorporate the feedback

## Learnings Log (from Dhruv's feedback)

### 2026-02-23 — Imagination Inc email (v1 → v3)

**Feedback 1:** "Don't write salesy reference emails. Just proper how we can help, then ask for demo."
- Removed flattery ("impressive portfolio")
- Removed "Best regards, Sumit / Founder" sign-off — Dhruv sends, Sumit on CC only

**Feedback 2:** "Too short. No proper context."
- Added specific module descriptions with concrete details
- Added 4-7% savings stat, 2,000+ companies, 10+ countries
- Each bullet now has a specific Onsite feature name + what it actually does for them

**Feedback 3:** "Don't say founder handles personally / transferring data from Excel. That creates discomfort. Just say we take care of onboarding."
- NEVER promise personal founder involvement in the email
- NEVER list specific onboarding steps (data transfer, training) — that's too much detail for a first email
- DO say: "We take care of the complete onboarding and setup" — one confident line, no specifics
- Rule: Support/onboarding = one simple reassuring line, not a sales pitch within the email

**Feedback 4:** "Add Task & Planning. Even after all this data you don't have better idea about Onsite."
- Task & Planning is a CORE module — always include it for any segment
- For interior firms: break show flats into tasks/sub-tasks, assign teams, track across sites
- Rule: ALWAYS include Task & Planning in the bullet points. It's not optional — it's one of Onsite's primary value props alongside Material and Subcontractor management.

**Feedback 5:** "We are sending to interior company and you are giving example of construction companies. Why can't you personalise?"
- NEVER use generic "2,000+ construction companies" when writing to a non-construction firm
- EVERY email must be fully personalized to the recipient's segment:
  - Interior firm → say "interior firms", mention their materials (tiles, fixtures, fabrics, paint, hardware), their trades (carpenters, painters, fabricators, glass workers), their deliverables (show flats, mood boards), their clients (developers)
  - Civil contractor → say "civil contractors", mention cement, steel, aggregate, RCC
  - EPC → say "infrastructure companies", mention multi-site, equipment, scheduling
- Use THEIR terminology: "show flat" not "project", "developer clients" not "clients", "mood boards" alongside "drawings"
- Social proof must match segment: "Interior firms using Onsite" not "construction companies"
- Rule: Read the email back and ask "would an interior designer feel this was written FOR them?" — if not, rewrite.
