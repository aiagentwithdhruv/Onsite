**Subject:** Managing interior projects across multiple sites?

Hi Sridhar,

This is Dhruv from Onsite Teams. We build project management software for interior and construction companies. I'm reaching out because managing show flat and sales office projects across Pune and Mumbai — with multiple trades running in parallel — is exactly the kind of coordination challenge our platform is built to solve.

Onsite gives you a single platform to manage everything from material procurement to subcontractor billing to client invoicing. Interior firms using Onsite typically see 4-7% savings on project costs just from better visibility and tighter controls across their sites.

For a firm handling multiple show flat and commercial interior projects like yours, here's what typically makes the biggest difference:

- **Task & Planning** — Break down each show flat into tasks and sub-tasks with timelines and dependencies. Assign them across your teams and track completion across all your Pune and Mumbai sites from one dashboard.
- **Material & Inventory** — Track what's ordered, what's on-site, and what's pending for every project — tiles, fixtures, hardware, paint, fabrics, everything. Compare vendor quotes side by side before creating POs, and catch discrepancies before they become cost overruns.
- **Design Management** — Keep all drawings, mood boards, revisions, and approvals organized in one place. Your site teams and office teams stay in sync without WhatsApp back-and-forth.
- **Subcontractor Management** — Issue work orders, track RA billing with retentions and deductions, and manage material issued to each trade — carpenters, painters, fabricators, glass workers, everyone.
- **Budget vs Actuals** — Know your real margins on each show flat during execution, not after handover. Track progress with geotagged photos and generate DPRs with a single click to share with your developer clients.

We take care of the complete onboarding and setup, so your team can get started without any friction.

Would you be open to a 15-20 minute demo? We can tailor it to how your team currently operates. Let us know a convenient time to connect.

Best,
Dhruv
