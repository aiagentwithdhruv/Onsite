## Seasonal Patterns

```
Q1 (Jan-Mar): PRIME SEASON
  - Budget allocation for new fiscal year
  - Pre-monsoon construction prep
  - Companies evaluating new tools
  → PUSH HARD on outreach and demos

Q2 (Apr-Jun): DIFFICULT
  - Peak construction season (pre-monsoon rush)
  - Teams too busy to evaluate software
  → Pipeline building only, no hard selling

Q3 (Jul-Sep): MIXED
  - Monsoon slows construction in most regions
  - Mid-year budget reviews
  - Some companies evaluating for next year
  → Nurture leads, education content

Q4 (Oct-Dec): SECOND WINDOW
  - Post-monsoon construction restart
  - "Use it or lose it" budget pressure
  - Festive season networking (ACETECH, construction expos)
  → Close deals, leverage year-end urgency
```

**Key Insight:** Best selling windows are Q1 + Q4 when teams have time to evaluate and implement.
