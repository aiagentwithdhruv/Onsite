## India Competitors

| Company | Key Differentiator | Scale | Pricing | Weakness vs Onsite |
|---------|-------------------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Powerplay** | Budget-friendly, mobile-first, strong marketing | 700K+ users, 85K projects | Freemium + paid tiers | Less ERP depth, more PM focused |
| **NYGGS** | AI-powered, IoT integration | Large infra (roads/highways) | Enterprise pricing | Niche (infra only), expensive |
| **StrategicERP** | IITian-built, highly flexible/customizable | 1,000+ companies | Custom quotes | Complex setup, not mobile-first |
| **RDash** | Expert-led, design-to-handover lifecycle | 9,000+ projects | Per-project pricing | Less financial/ERP capability |
| **FalconBrick** | Offline capability, site monitoring focus | Mid-market | Custom | Narrow feature set |
| **Highrise ERP** | Claims 15% cost savings | Builders/contractors | Custom | Less proven, smaller user base |
| **NWAY ERP** | 480+ cities, IoT integration | Pan-India | Custom | Complex, enterprise-focused |

### India Competitor Patterns
- Most target either **small contractors** (Powerplay) or **large infra** (NYGGS, NWAY)
- Mid-market (50-500 employee builders) is underserved — Onsite's sweet spot
- None have AI-powered sales intelligence on top of CRM
- Hindi language support is rare — Onsite advantage
- Most lack integrated quotation automation

| **Procore** | $199-375/user/month | 3M+ projects, 150 countries | Market leader, deep integrations, analytics |
| **Buildertrend** | $299-499/month (unlimited users) | Residential SMB | Unlimited users model, simple UX |
| **PlanGrid (Autodesk)** | $39-199/user/month | 2M+ projects | Blueprint management, Autodesk ecosystem |
| **Fieldwire** | Custom pricing | 2M+ projects | Task management, field-first design |

### Global Competitor Patterns
- Pricing is 10-20x higher than Onsite ($2,388-4,500/user/year vs $200-250)
- All optimized for Western construction practices
- None understand Indian regulatory requirements (GST, RERA, labor laws)
- Most require lengthy implementation (months vs Onsite's 1-2 weeks)
- Document-heavy vs Onsite's mobile-first approach

## Onsite's Competitive Edge

### vs India Competitors
1. **Full ERP stack** — Not just project management, includes financials, procurement, HR
2. **AI-powered intelligence** — Only Indian construction SaaS with LLM-based lead scoring + sales agents
3. **Mobile-first design** — Built for site workers with phones, not managers with laptops
4. **Fast implementation** — 1-2 weeks vs months for StrategicERP or NWAY
5. **White Label option** — Competitors don't offer branded versions for large builders

### vs Global Competitors
1. **10-20x cheaper** — ₹12,000-15,000/user/year vs $2,388-4,500
2. **India-specific compliance** — GST, RERA, PF, ESI built-in
3. **Hindi + regional language support** — Most global tools are English-only
4. **WhatsApp integration** — Universal communication channel in Indian construction
5. **Local support** — Same-timezone, same-language customer success

## Competitive Win/Loss Patterns

### We Win When:
- Customer is mid-market Indian builder (50-500 employees)
- They need financial/ERP features beyond project management
- They value fast implementation (1-2 weeks)
- They need mobile-first for field workers
- Price sensitivity is high (comparing to Procore/Oracle)
- They need GST/RERA compliance features

### We Lose When:
- Customer is pure infrastructure/highway (NYGGS specialty)
- They need deep BIM/design integration (Autodesk/PlanGrid)
- They're already locked into Procore/Oracle with multi-year contracts
- Very small (<10 users) where Powerplay's freemium wins
- They prioritize offline capability above all else (FalconBrick)
